Subject: aio_notify(): force main loop wakeup with SIGIO (aarch64 host only)

O-Subject: [RHELSA qemu-kvm-rhev PATCH 1/2] aio_notify(): force main loop wakeup with SIGIO (aarch64 host only)

This should be happening, before the patch:

  thread pool worker thread                                 main iothread
  -------------------------                                 -------------
        aio_notify()
             |
          write() ------------------[eventfd]---------------> g_poll()

But g_poll is not woken(). The notification is lost on aarch64/KVM, and we
don't know why.

The patch introduces the following (theoretically superfluous) additional
notification chain, activated under the same circumstances:

  thread pool worker thread     sigwait_compat() thread     main iothread
  -------------------------     -----------------------     -------------
        aio_notify()
             |
           kill() -----[SIGIO]-----> sigwait()
                                        |
                                      write() -----[pipe]---> g_poll()

(The SIGIO signal is generated for the entire process, but it can only be
consumed by the sigwait() call in sigwait_compat(), because that's the
only thread and section of code where SIGIO is unblocked.

After the main iothread wakes, it dispatches the sigfd_compat_info
received over the pipe to the sigfd_handler() function, which (seeing the
SIG_DFL disposition for SIGIO, which coincides with NULL) simply throws it
away.)

This patch should make no difference (beyond a minuscule performance hit),
but in practice it makes the hang go away, by reliably waking g_poll().
